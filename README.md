A neural network called angel-nn that is fed discrete Mariah Carey whistle register notes by users and the clicked canvas positions

angel-nn can then be trained on the data and can predict a continuous note frequency mapped to the positions and notes that the user fed in

uses ml5.js for machine learning, p5.js and the p5-sound addon for canvas and audio
